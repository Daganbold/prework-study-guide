# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
Welcome to my study guide as well as my first ever project. This will be where I store most of the general/critical information I deem essential to my success in class!
Essentially, this project will make accessing the information I learned, much easier and organized.
Through simply creating the project, I was able to learn exactly what what is listed through an interactive manner.

## Installation

## Usage

Just open the web page and follow the list and check out what I learned and for a more in depth experience, check out the console feature by inspecting element by right-clicking anywhere on the page! Within the console, we can see javascript in action by randomly selecting what we can study first.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
